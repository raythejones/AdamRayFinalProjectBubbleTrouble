<h1> The Idea </h1>
Inspired by one of their favorite childhood games: <a href="https://www.miniclip.com/games/bubble-trouble/en/"><b><i> Bubble Trouble </b></i></a> by Miniclip, Adam and Ray set out to recreate this. Armed with a shaky idea of what physics is, A1 java skills, theoretical Processing skills and a ton of imagination - this is their end product.

<h1> Features </h1>
No, this isn't an exact replica. That would be illegal! But it is a super cool mockup that sacrificed some features and brought in others to make the final game. Here's some of the cool things we have to offer:
<ul>
    <li> Difficulty Levels! Choose between Easy, Medium, and Hard <ul> <li>These control the powerup spawn rate, and bubble lives</li> </ul> </li>
    <li> Powerups! Watch random powerups spawn and fall, giving you things like increased speed or invincibility </li>
    <li> Increasing Difficulty! Everytime you clear a wave of bubbles a new one spawns - plus an extra bubble! </li>
</ul>

<h1> Development Log! </h1>
In true Stuyvesant fashion, our development cycle follows an exponential path - it starts off slow and steady and picks up the weekend before its due :) Here's our big milestones:
